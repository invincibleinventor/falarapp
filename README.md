### Tech Stack

- NextJS + TailwindCSS for frontend
- React-Markdown to render Markdown
- MDXEditor for Markdown Editor component
- Supabase as a serverless backend
- Google OAuth for Google Sign In

### Note (NextJS 13+)

- The project utilizes NextJS 13+ (Server Actions)
- Client and Server components are seperated in proper bounds. Intensive tasks are loaded through the server and interactivity is done through client components
- This project therefore demands a good knowledge on NextJS 13 Server Actions & Client Components

### Future Updates 

- Extend the notification system
- Ability to direct message other users
